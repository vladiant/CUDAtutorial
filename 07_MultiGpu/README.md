# Multi-GPU Programming

## Execute parts on separate devices
* Split the work
* Execute kernels on separate threads
* Combine the results

## Use `cudaSetDevice(id)` to select the device to run on

## Portable zero-copy memory useful for multi-threading

## Summary
* Running on multiple devices is not difficult
